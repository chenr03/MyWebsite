            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>I am the Bank Manager of a mid-sized Missouri Bank called UMB, part-time student, and soon to be web developer.</p>
            <p>I am an extremely creative person, and I love web development & design.</p>

            <h6> More About Me </h6>
            <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
            <p>My favorite hobby is to play disc golf because it is a great free exercise, it takes a good amount of skill, and its extremely fun. </p>
            <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
            <p>My dream job is similar to my current job except instead problem-solving in the financial world, I would be doing it on the front and back-end of web development.</p>
            <h2>Where do you live?</h2>
            <p>I currently live in another suburb city outside of St. Louis, called Affton MO.</p>
            <h2>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h2>
            <p>Because programming is awesome and being able to make a difference in this world in a constantly changing environment makes more sense in my eyes. At my current job I am making a difference but they are small scale differences. Programming would be helping people on a much larger scale. </p>
